Project Goal:
The project aims to analyze Netflix's content strategy by examining data on content titles, type (show or movie), genre, language, release details, and viewership metrics. The goal is to understand how these factors contribute to audience engagement and viewership patterns.
Data Used:
The project utilizes a dataset called "netflix_content_2023.csv". This dataset likely contains information about Netflix content released in 2023, including details such as title, release date, language, content type (show or movie), availability status, and viewership hours.

Steps Taken:
1.	Data Loading and Cleaning:
o	The project starts by importing necessary libraries like Pandas, Plotly, and ydata_profiling.
o	It then loads the Netflix dataset into a Pandas DataFrame.
o	Data cleaning is performed on the "Hours Viewed" column, ensuring it's in the correct numeric format for analysis.

3.	Content Type Analysis:
o	Total viewership hours are compared between shows and movies to understand which content type dominates.

4.	Language Analysis:
o	Viewership distribution across different languages is analyzed to determine which languages contribute the most to content consumption.

5.	Release Date Analysis:
o	Viewership is analyzed based on release dates to identify trends over time, such as seasonality or patterns around specific months.

6.	Top Content Analysis:
o	The most successful content (shows and movies) are identified based on viewership hours, and their characteristics (genre, theme) are examined.

7.	Viewership Trends by Content Type:
o	Viewership trends for shows and movies are compared throughout the year to understand how audience engagement varies.

8.	Release Season Analysis:
o	Viewership is analyzed across different release seasons (Winter, Spring, Summer, Fall) to identify patterns.

9.	Monthly Release Patterns:
o	The number of content releases and their corresponding viewership hours are analyzed across months to identify correlations.

10.	Weekly Release Patterns:
o	Content release and viewership patterns are analyzed across weekdays to determine if Netflix favors specific release days.

11.	Holiday and Event Analysis:
o	Content releases are examined in relation to significant holidays or events to understand if Netflix strategically releases content around these dates.

Insights and Conclusion:
•	Shows consistently outperform movies in viewership.
•	English-language content dominates viewership, but non-English content also has a significant share.
•	Viewership spikes are observed in December and June, suggesting strategic content releases during these periods.
•	The Fall season experiences the highest audience engagement.
•	Friday is the most popular day for content releases and viewership.
•	Netflix strategically releases content around holidays and events to maximize viewership.
